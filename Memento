- Generality:
	-> If they are quoted, they shall be ignored
	-> If they are escaped, they shall be ignored
	-> If they are inside bracket expression, they are considered as normal char (except ' [ ')
	-> If the pattern does not match any existing filenames or pathnames, the pattern string shall be left unchanged
	-> The leading <period> ' . ' CANNOT match with anything
		-> ' * '
		-> ' ? '
		-> ' [ ' with all the possible expression ( excluding list / range etc...)
	-> All characters except ' * ', ' ? ' and ' [ ' are considered as normal char
- Special characters:
	-> ' * '
		-> It's pretty simple... Can match with any string, including nothing, excluding ' / '
	-> ' ? '
		-> It's pretty simple... Can match with anything, excluding nothing and ' / '
	-> ' [ '
		-> ' [ ' open a bracket expression ' ] ' closed it
		-> More or less: Check with the characters between ' [ ' and ' ] '
		-> Here's the tricky part:
		-> If an expression start with ' ! ', all characters will be tested except those in the list
		-> Range an expression could be [x-y] that takes all the characters between x and y (man ascii)
		-> ' [.(...).] ' will be always treated as false... Cause Locale
		-> ' [=(...)=] ' will be always treated as false... Cause Locale
		-> ' [:(...):] ' are fixed with the Local UTF8 and the only possibilities are
			-> [:alnum:] [:cntrl:] [:lower:] [:space:] [:alpha:] [:digit:] [:print:] [:upper:] [:blank:] [:graph:] [:punct:] [:xdigit:]
			-> They have all their corresponding is(...)
